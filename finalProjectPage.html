      <h1 id="home-header">Ella's Final Project!</h1>
       
        <p>For my final Project I created a user freindly app that allows people to explore drawing in a simple way.<br>
        This app allows mistakes to happen, because an erase button is included! The user has many color options they can use to create their picture.<br>
        For some people, creative activities are challenging. Therefore, this app includes an option where you can be given a suggestion of what to draw!<br>
        Likewise, for young children this app can be interatcive because they can recieve positive feedback on their drawings with just on click. Children spend <br>
        alot of time on devices, so this app allows them to spend their time doing something craetve while also<br>
        feeling confident in their artistic abilities because they receive feedback! 
            <br>This is a <strong>great</strong> way for children to spend free time doing something productive. Likewise, a child learning to be confindnet<br>
            is necessary for future development, and this app can help with that!</p>
