        <p>For my final Project I created a user friendly app that allows people to explore drawing in a simple way. In my program<br>
        I included an erase button because I wanted people to have the option to alter their picture, or they can utilize this<br> 
        aspect if they make a mistake. The user has many color options they can use to create their picture. For some people, <br>
        creative activities are challenging. Therefore, this app includes an option where you can they can be given a suggestion<br>
        of what to draw! Likewise, for young children this app can be an interatcive actvity considering recieve positive feedback <br>
        on their drawings with just one click. The app has the duel benefit of creative time use and may trigger interest in computer. <br>
        Although this porgram is simple, it is an easy way to be creative. Creativity<br>  does not have to be complicated it can be simple.<br></p>
