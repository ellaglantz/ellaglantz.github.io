        <p>For my final Project I created a user friendly app that allows people to explore drawing in a simple way. In my program,<br>
        I included an erase button because I wanted people to have the option to alter their picture, or they can utilize this<br> 
        aspect if they make a mistake. The user has many color options they can use to create their picture. For some people, <br>
        creative activities are challenging. Therefore, this app includes an option where you can they can be given a suggestion<br>
        of what to draw! Likewise, for young children this app can be an interative actvity because they can chose to receive positive<br>
        feedback on their drawings. The app has the duel benefit of creative time use as well as possibly triggering an interest in computer <br>
        science. Although this program is simple, it is an easy way to be creative. Creativity does not have to be complicated, it can be simple.<br>
        Likewise, in my program you cannot draw outside the white rectangle, as this is more similar to how a realistic program would be modeled. </p>
