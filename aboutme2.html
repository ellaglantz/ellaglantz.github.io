           I am a freshmen at
            <a target=" blank" href="https://www.uri.edu">the University of Rhode Island.</a> 
            I am majoring in Computer Science and either hope to minor in <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> or <strong>Mathematics</strong>. I Have a brother who is a senior at URI 
            and my mom also went to URI. I have two cats whose names are Peakey and Norm. I love nature and being in nature.  
            I enjoy going to the    <a target=" blank" href="https://www.nps.gov/caco/index.htm">Cape Cod National Seashore</a> in Eastham. My two favorite bands are Black Sabbath and Alice in Chains. 
            In the winter I go skiing in New Hampshire with my family! Although I love the summer, I think I appreicate the fall and winter more.</p>
